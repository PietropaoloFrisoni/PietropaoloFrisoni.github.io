# Pietropaolo Frisoni - Computational Scientist

Welcome to my personal GitHub.io page! I am Pietropaolo Frisoni, a computational scientist passionate about exploring the intersections of physics, mathematics, and computer science.

## About Me

I currently work as a Quantum Software Developer II at Xanadu Quantum Technologies (Toronto, Canada).
I recently obtained a Ph.D. in Physics at Western University with a Scientific Computing collaborative specialization, developing new computational methods in loop quantum gravity. My interests span scientific computing and the application of computational techniques to problems in physics and mathematics. 
When not working on those, I can usually be found playing the guitar.
